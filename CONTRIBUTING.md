## Contribution
 * Contributions are always welcome. Language doesn't matter. Just make sure you're implementing an algorithm.
 * PRs are welcome. To begin developing, follow the structure:

   > algorithm_name/language-name/file_name.extension

   e.g
   > bubble_sort/python/bubble_sort.py

 * If you want to include a new algorithm make a new folder as per the above structure.
 * Please include a description for the new algorithm that you are implementing. It doesn't matter if it's copied from somewhere as long as it helps people that are learning new algorithm.
 * Graphical examples would be very helpful too.
 * Beautify and cleanup your code for easier reading
